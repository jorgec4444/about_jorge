From January 2023 until September 2024 I worked at Merkle as a Software developer cooperating with
the Sky company. I joined the company in my last career year and I started to put agile and SAFe
methodologies into practice on a daily basis. I worked for the sky customer CARE team providing
solutions and giving support on the troubleshooting area going through all phases of a programme's
lifecycle. I worked mostly in the backend part of the troubleshooting area managing the
troubleshooting program direction managing routers, boosters and devices errors to help sky agents
to solve the customer issues.
