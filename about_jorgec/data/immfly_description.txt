From July 2022 until December 2022 I worked at Immfly, a company that created an entertainment system
for the airplanes that allows passengers to play games, watch movies or series or even order
products during the flight. My role in the company during my internship was as a data analyst,
contributing to the new Data team providing analysis and data structures of all our solutions for
airlines, such as pre-order and retail on board and inflight entertainment. The team had a wide-range
of goals from creating, maintaining and improving data structures to forecasting and discovering new
and insightful KPI's with the use of Machine Learning. We also helped our partners to perform
data-oriented decisions, such as feedback classification for NPS or stock prediction.
